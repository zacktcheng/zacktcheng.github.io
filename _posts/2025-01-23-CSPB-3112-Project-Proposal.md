# Project Proposal
## Vision Statement
The idea for this project is to document my certification preperation progress toward earning the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer **(CKAD)** 
hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with the Linux Foundation.

The progress will be weeks of studying and practicing towards a few learning materials:

[GitHub](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises)
[Killer Shell](https://killer.sh/ckad)
## Motivation
As an associate Software Engineer at the Site Reliability Engineering team with no prior knowledge about CICD, I found having a solid foundation extremely
critical to complete my daily tasks with confidence. To gain familiarity to CICD, I would like to master one of its key component, which is Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
