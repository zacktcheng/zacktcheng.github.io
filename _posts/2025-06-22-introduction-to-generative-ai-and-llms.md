## How does traditional AI work
Traditional AI models are trained to accomplish a specific task.
1. Data collection
   - This can be done via scraping, APIs, properietary data and buying data.
3. Data labeling
   - Label the data in a way that is understandable and relavant to the AI model.
   - Data cleaning.
5. Training
   - Run a training process to output a functioning model.
7. Testing
   - Test to ensure the AI model functions as expected.
   - Fine tune and reinforce as needed.
9. Production
    - Ensure the model is performant, handles the expected load, and scales as needed.

## LLMs: The future of AI
- LLMs uses vast amounts of natual language data to learn and understand language patterns.
- Can be used to produce text content, generatate code, build chat bots, validate data and more.
- Trained on generic data and fine-tuned for specific tasks means more accessible and requires less knowledge and budget.

Common applications of LLMs
- Natural Language Processing
- Content Creation
- Code Generation
- Autonomous Agents
