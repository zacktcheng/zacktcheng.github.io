# Project Proposal
## Vision Statement
The idea for this project is to document my certification preperation progress toward earning the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer **(CKAD)** 
hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with the Linux Foundation.

The progress will be weeks of studying and practicing towards a few learning materials:
- [Udemy (my primary studying material)](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/?couponCode=MT24125CUS)
- [GitHub Exercise (open-sourced)](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises)
- [Killer Shell (need to purchase an account?)](https://killer.sh/ckad)
## Motivation
As an associate Software Engineer at the Site Reliability Engineering team with little prior knowledge about CICD, I found having a solid foundation extremely
critical to complete my daily tasks with confidence. To gain familiarity to CICD, I would like to master one of its key component, which is Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
## Specific and measurable Goals
- Complete all 14 modules in the Udemy course, for each module, writing a GitHub blog post summarizing what I have learned.
- Record some mini practice project as videos or, push the practice code on GigHub.
- Study for and take the CKAD exam, document down my experience in the final blog post.
## Risks to Project Completion
- It will take sometime for me to be comfortable with operating the project with the Linux command line tools *(CSPB 3308 was the only course in which I learned Linux)*.
- Configure and provision the specific environment on my machine to work on the project.
- Limited budget to create accounts to purchase cloud services if I need extra practices or to research the course supplements.
- As a full-time working student, sometimes, a suddent workload or request at my job might impact my studying.
## Mitigation Strategy
- [Week 3 - Week 5]: Quickly complete 15/18 modules of [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/introduction-to-kubernetes) to gain the basics, make
  blog posts for each module.
  The modules are:
    - Course Introduction
    - From Monolith to Microservices
    - Container Orchestration
    - Kubernetes
    - Kubernetes Architecture
    - Minikube: Installing Local Kubernetes Clusters
    - Accessing Minikube
    - Kubernetes Building Blocks
    - Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control
    - Services
    - Deploying a Standalone Application
    - Kubernetes Volume Management
    - ConfigMaps and Secrets
    - Ingress
- [Week 6 - Week 10]: Study the course from the Introduction module to the Helm Foundamental module of the Udemy course. For each module, write a GitHub post to reflect what I learned.
  The modules are:
    - Introduction
    - Core Concepts
    - Configuration
    - Multi-Container Pods
    - Observability
    - POD Design
    - Services & Networking
    - State Persistence
    - Security
    - Helm Fundamentals
    - Additional Practice - Kubernetes Challenges
    - Certification Tips
    - Lightning Labs
    - Mock Exams
- [Week 11 - ]: Study the course from the Additional Practice to the Mock Exam module. Explore some GitHub Excersice and Killer shell practices. Write blog post to showcase what I learned.
  If the time is right and I am well-prepared at the moment, I shall take the exam and share the experience on one blog post.
## Project Assessments
- Do I complete and post for each course module? The modules are listed above.
- Does the blog layouts properly? Are pages easy to read with picures or graphs?
- Do the blog posts convey important and rich information covered in and extended from the course as well as personal insights?
- Did I take the certification exam by week 15? Success or failure?
