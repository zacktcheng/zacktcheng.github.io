## What is Container Orchestration

### Introducing Containers

A container is a self-contained unit of software that packages an application with all its necessary dependencies (code, libraries, runtime environment) allowing it to run consistently across different computing environments, essentially acting like a portable, lightweight virtualized application that can be easily deployed and managed on various platforms.

Containers provides high-performing, scalable applications on any infrastructure of your choice. They are best suited to deliver microservices by providing portable, isolated virtual environments for applications to run without interference from other running applications. Microservices are lightweight applications, they are encapsulated with their dependencies inside containers; However, containers do not run them directly, they run container images instead.

### What about the Container Images?

Container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable software package. It includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings, and it represents the source of a container deployed to offer an isolated executable environment for the application. Containers can be deployed from a specific image on many platforms, such as workstations, Virtual Machines, public cloud, etc.
