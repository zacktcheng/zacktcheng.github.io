## Ingress

Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

Ingress can decouple the routing rules from the application and centralize the rules management, that way we can then update our application without worrying about its external access. With Ingress, users do not connect directly to a Service. Users reach the Ingress endpoint, and, from there, the request is forwarded to the desired Service.

## Ingress Controllers

An Ingress Controller is an application watching the Control Plane Node's API server for changes in the Ingress resources and updates the Layer 7 Load Balancer accordingly. An Ingress Controller is also known as Controllers, Ingress Proxy, Service Proxy, Reverse Proxy, etc. Kubernetes supports an array of Ingress Controllers, and, if needed, we can also build our own.
