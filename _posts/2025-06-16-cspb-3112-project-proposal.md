# Project Proposal

## Vision Statement
My project will be learning to build AI agents and chat bots using Typescript, OpenAI, Vector Store, FUnctions, LlamaIndex, etc, following along the Udemy course material:

- [AI For JavaScript Developers (OpenAI, Embeddings, Vercel AI)](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-for-js-devs)

Through this project, I hope to learn:
- Basic understanding of generative AI, LLM, and how they differ from traditional AI
- How to use the OpenAI SDK, the Vercel AI SDK with Next.js to build chatbot
- Basic AI concepts such as the anatomy of Chat Completions, Tokens, System Prompts, Prompt Engineering
- How to utilize Vector Stores (Embeddings) to store large amounts of data and provide additional context to the AI


## Motivation
AI and LLM have recently become heavily involved in the software development lifecycle. Although I am still very new to this field, ever since I started my career in 2023 , for every few weeks/months, thereâ€™s some generative AI tool coming out for software development, thus I sense the urgency to pick up some of the AI application skills that could be useful for my daily jobs. As a TypeScript developer, this course project which will be built in Typescript is a great choice for me to start off.

## Specific and measurable Goals
- Complete all five course modules. For each module, there will be a GitHub blog post as a note to reflect the key knowledge taught in the module, as well as my personal insights.
- A fully-working project to showcase the final chatbot result. I will try to find a free cloud service to host my application, else I will record a demonstration video and include it to my final GitHub post.


## Risks to Project Completion
- Local project setup and third party tools and library installation.
- Learning the concept of generative AI and LLMs.
- Troubleshooting bugs and errors encountered during the learning/development.
- As a full-time working student, sometimes, a sudden workload or request at my job might impact my studying.

## Mitigation Strategy
Setting clear weekly goals may help me follow the course better.

Week 3 - 4: Complete the project setup

Week 5 - 7: Learn the basics of building with OpenAI
- Project structure
- First OpenAI chat completion
- Conversation state and AI chatbots
- Introduction to tokens
- System messages
- Providing knowledge to the LLM
- Hallucinations
- Services
- Getting structured JSON output
- OpenAI function calling

Week 8: Learn Vector Stores and Embeddings
- Intro to Vector Stores
- Storing PDF in a Vector Store
- Querying the Vector store
- Week 9: Learn to fetch realtime data
- Week 10 - 13: Build the final project - PDF Chat Bot
- Setup the repository
- Upload and parse the PDF
- Store the PDF in Vector Store
- Learn Vercel AI SDK
- Set up Chat API endpoints
- Handling token limits
- Polising my project
- Record or deploy my project

## Project Assessments
- Do I complete and post for each course module?
- Does the blog layouts properly? Are pages easy to read with diagrams or graphs?
- Do the blog posts convey important and rich information covered in and extended from the course as well as personal insights?
- Do I successfully showcase my final project result?
